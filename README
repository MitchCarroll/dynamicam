DynamiCam is a program for generating digital camouflage patterns. DynamiCam is also the name of the family of patterns generated.

Currently, this program is a BASH script that uses ImageMagick to perform Fourier transforms on a set of source images, manipulates the resulting transformed images, and applies an inverse transform, dithering colors, and remapping to an optimized pallet to generate a camouflage pattern.
The resulting pattern should match the spatial frequencies of the input images, as well as provide a good match to the colors, based on a perceptual model, at a variety of viewing distances.
The use of a similar method to the Perlin Noise algorithm ensures a tilable pattern that does not exhibit isoluminance at any viewing distance, while the radial symmetry of the spatial frequency map helps create a smooth sinusoidal transition between color patterns at any angle.

work is still in progress on the basic method, as well as some of the more theoreticl issues and practical concerns, such as NIR concealability for tactical and hunting use.
