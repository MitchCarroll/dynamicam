a program that dynamically creates a digital camoflage pattern based on a 
basic perlin noise fractal process. the user defines the desired size, 
number of colors, the hexidecimal value for the desired colors, and the 
number of 'layers' and the dimensions of each layer in the pattern.
the end result is a customized camoflage pattern that is composed of blocks of
color, each of which is composed of smaller blocks of color, and so forth.
the color transitions smoothly from block to block, and the resulting pattern
is tilable.
